Alex Ngari Weru - Autobiography

Introduction

I think my life has been quite worthwhile and I hope you will find my autobiography interesting. As well as all this I want people in other countries to know what a person in a different county's life is like.

This autobiography is about my life up till now from my earliest memories to my current journey at university. I hope you will enjoy this book and I hope it will bring back memories from your past.

Hello there! My name is Alex Ngari Weru and I am 23 years old. At the present, I am studying at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) in my final year pursuing Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I am extremely excited and grateful for the opportunity to provide some insights into my life and who I am. I would with much love and appreciation share my background with you.

Chapter One

I come from a loving family where I am rather fortunate to have supportive parents named Mr. Joseph Weru Muchina and Mrs. Loise Waithiegeni Weru. Along with them, I have two siblings named Edwin Muchina Weru (born 3rd January 2005) and Lewis Kiboi Weru (born 23rd April 2008). We reside in Nyeri County, Kieni East District, Kabaru Location, Mbiriri Village, where we cherish spending quality time together engaging in various activities. My parents have always been my role models. Both of my parents emphasize the importance of education and have always encouraged me to pursue my dreams.

On Tuesday 30th April 2002, I was born in Nyeri General Hospital and my star sign is Taurus. I am very glad I am called Alex because the name has grown to represent my identity and aspirations. My name was finally decided by my parents who wanted a name that would inspire greatness. I was baptized at the age of three at Kimahuri Catholic Church by Fr. Njoroge. "Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, and Grandparents came to Kimahuri Catholic Church for the Christening then came back to our house for lunch" Mum recalls.

Growing up, our household was always filled with laughter, stories, and support. My siblings and I share a close bond; we often spend our weekends playing games, watching movies, or going on family outings. We also have a family tradition of having reunions every December where we feast on goat and sheep meat. Each member of the family gets to contribute to the preparations, and we all pitch in to make it successful. This not only brings us closer but also teaches us the value of teamwork and cooperation.

My grandparents also play a significant role in my life. They live in a nearby town, and we visit them often. They share stories from their past, which are always fascinating and filled with life lessons. These stories have instilled in me a deep respect for our family history and traditions.

"Close friends had their baby Christened at the same time which made it special" adds Mum. I was an all-right baby at night waking about every four hours for milk.

"Fortunately, Alex slept well at night because I needed a rest having pushed the pram all day as this was the only time that Alex didn't cry," says Mum.

"Alex was quite adventurous from a young age, always curious about everything around him" Mum also says.

I cut my first tooth at about four and a half months old round about the time of a normal baby. I started walking when I was eight and a half months old. I am very accident prone as Gran says: "Poor Alex has to be taken to A&E on several occasions as a toddler with various childhood injuries."

Additionally, I relish playing soccer and being active. Sports not only keep me physically active but also teach me the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship. I am the chairman for Mbiriri FC, and we practice regularly. We have participated in several local tournaments, and each game brings a new lesson and experience.

Expressing my creativity through technology and innovation is another passion I am deeply committed to. I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages and development techniques, and I have a collection of projects and applications that I am very proud of. Technology allows me to express my thoughts and bring ideas to life in a way that words sometimes cannot.

Moreover, I find delight in farming and agricultural activities. We often explore new farming techniques together as a family, trying out different crops and animal husbandry methods. Farming with my parents is not just about growing food; it's a time of bonding, laughter, and learning. I have learned to manage various aspects of farming on my own, and my family often praises my agricultural experiments.

Exploring nature through hiking mountain climbing and wildlife exploration with my family is yet another activity that fills me with happiness. We frequently visit nearby parks and nature reserves. These outings provide a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life and offer a chance to connect with nature. We enjoy observing different plants and animals, and I often bring my camera along to capture the beauty around me.

When I was about one and a half I started talking and my first words were 'mum' and 'dada'. I had the usual childhood illnesses but apart from that I wasn't seriously ill.

Bananas and baked bread popularly known as chapati were my favorite solid food but I like yoghurts as well.

My favorite toy was a plastic tool box and I was always clutching a tool and my Gran said I even took it on holiday with me.

Chapter Two
Earliest Memories

It was Christmas Eve, and I found myself wide awake, filled with anticipation. The next day was going to be special; I was about to receive my very first games console. The thought of finally plugging it in and diving into a world of gaming thrilled me to no end. My room was shrouded in darkness, with only a faint glow slipping through the crack in my door, creating an uncanny atmosphere around me. Unable to escape my excitement, I began imagining all the games I wished to play before eventually drifting off to sleep.

When morning finally arrived, I switched on my light and was jolted awake by the realization that it was already 2 o'clock in the morning. "Oh no!" I exclaimed to myself, feeling a mix of excitement and impatience. "I still have five long hours to wait before I can wake up Mum and Dad! What am I going to do?" I attempted to get back to sleep, but my excitement consumed me.

So, I made my way silently to the landing to see if Santa had indeed made his rounds during the night.

To my delight, I discovered that he had arrived! My stocking was overflowing with an assortment of presents, and a smaller stocking filled to the brim with candies stood nearby. The sight was almost unbearable—I longed to tear into everything right then and there, but the wait was disheartening. I returned to my bedroom, feeling a twinge of disappointment, and snuggled back into bed. I tossed and turned, my mind racing with thoughts of wonderful gifts until, at long last, the clock struck seven.

With a rush of energy, I threw off my blankets and leapt out of bed. I bounded into my parents' room, clutching my stockings, before sprinting back to the pile of presents that had overflowed from them. The sheer joy of the moment propelled me into a frenzy as I shouted, "It's Christmas! It's Christmas!" My enthusiastic outburst stirred the entire household and somehow even managed to awaken my brothers.

After the initial spirited chaos, the atmosphere gradually calmed down. The only sound that filled the air was that of wrapping paper being ripped apart followed by my brothers' gleeful exclamations of, "Look what I got! Look what I got!" My heart raced as I searched for my own treasure. Finally, I found it.

In a rush of excitement, I called for my dad, who stumbled into my room still groggy from sleep, ready to help me set it up. The anticipation built as I prepared to immerse myself in new adventures. Hours flew by as I played, truly experiencing one of the best Christmases I could have ever imagined.

Speaking of cherished memories, I also recalled delightful days spent exploring the beautiful Kenyan landscape. The weather was gorgeous, with the sun shining brightly in the sky as my family and I gathered for various outings. The sight was picturesque, complete with fluffy clouds drifting by and birds soaring overhead. My friends and I amused ourselves with various games, basking in the warm glow of the day.

When we finally arrived at our destinations, we couldn't contain our excitement. The rides promised plenty of fun, and we leaned over railings, watching the beautiful scenery pass by. The anticipation of new adventures filled our hearts.

Once we disembarked, we stepped out and walked towards new experiences. We were all buzzing with energy as we made our way to explore new territories. Eager to explore and see all the sights, we couldn't wait to set off.

However, the days sometimes took unexpected turns. While making our way through various adventures, we encountered unexpected challenges. The chaos erupted as our parents shouted warnings to us. In split seconds, we had to react quickly, and I could feel the tension dissipate as collective sighs of relief filled the air once we were safely out of harm's way.

After those minor scares, we continued our adventures without any issues. We spent the rest of the days exploring beautiful landscapes, and enjoying the freedom that came with discovery. The sun shone down on us, and the laughter of friends accompanied every new experience. It truly was wonderful outings.

Both the memories of magical Christmas mornings and fun-filled exploration days will always hold a special place in my heart. Each moment was filled with excitement, joy, and a sense of adventure that shaped my childhood. Christmas remained a time of wonder and happiness, and fun outings with friends only added to the tapestry of treasured moments I carry with me.

Chapter Three
Earliest School Memories

I have a profound passion for learning, which is reflected in my enthusiasm for certain subjects at school. Mathematics captivates me with its intricate problem-solving challenges and the logic behind numbers. I enjoy tackling difficult problems and finding solutions. My teacher often gives me extra problems to solve, which I gladly take on.

Science fascinates me as I unravel the wonders of the natural world and conduct exciting experiments. I love learning about different scientific concepts and seeing them in action through experiments. My favorite topics include technology and innovation, where I learn about computers and programming, and biology, where I study different forms of life.

Technology provides me with a medium to express my creativity freely. I enjoy our computer classes, where we explore various forms of digital creation, including programming, web development, and digital design. Each project is an opportunity to learn something new and push my creative boundaries.

Physical Education allows me to engage in sports and maintain an active lifestyle. I enjoy participating in different sports activities, from soccer and skating to swimming and mountain climbing. These activities keep me fit and teach me the importance of staying active and healthy.

I remember my first day at school when I was in P1 at St. Teresa Academy. I didn't always like school and sometimes I didn't want to go. I soon settled down though, once I got to know my teachers, who were very nice. The classroom was bustling with energy, there were about 30 people in my class. I remember making friends who actually lived near me. My favorite subjects were mathematics and sciences because I enjoyed logical thinking and problem solving. I liked it when it came to practical sessions though because I liked hands-on learning.

I also liked lunch, because I could see people from older classes I knew and I loved the food that I had for lunch. We were also allowed to have lunch outside when it was sunny. I also liked lunch because the next step was playtime.

I loved play time because I could run about, get fresh air, and see pals from other classes. I knew quite a lot of people from other classes and I began to like them even more when the classes were muddled up. I liked playtime most in the summer though because you were allowed to play various games. My favorite games in the playground were 'tag' and various ball games.

Sometimes though I don't like being in the playground because one day I was playing tag with some friends when I tripped over somebody's school bag that was lying on the ground, luckily though I had my school bag on otherwise it would have been really painful. Everyone was laughing at me. I went red because I was so embarrassed. I ran over to the teacher I was with and she gave me assistance. Then the bell rang and I went into school feeling happy again.

Chapter Four
My Family Heritage

My family, the Weru family, has a very interesting history and this is part of it. My family has lived most of their lives in Nyeri County, where we have deep roots and connections to the land.

Our family has always valued education and hard work. My parents instilled in us the importance of both traditional knowledge and modern education. They taught us to respect our heritage while embracing progress and innovation.

The start of my educational journey was supported by my parents who believed in the power of knowledge. They worked hard to ensure we had access to good schools and learning opportunities.

When I grew older, I began to appreciate the sacrifices my parents made for our education. By now I was becoming more aware of the world around me and started to work on developing my skills and talents.

It must have been very hard for my parents to provide for all of us but they did and that commitment forms the foundation of my family's story.

Chapter Five
Childhood Experiences

When I was 10, I had a rough day at school. My lunch was untouched because of a severe stomach ache and a pounding headache. I went outside but felt too unwell to play, so I retreated to the bathroom. I considered going to the medical room but felt briefly better and went back out to play, only for the pain to return. After enduring the long recess, I went back to the classroom, where the heat worsened my headache. In the middle of my work, I felt sick again and informed my teacher, then headed to the medical room to lie down, wishing for home-time.

Feeling slightly better, I returned to class but soon felt worse just before the final bell. I met my mum outside, avoided the bus, and went home to rest on the sofa.

Despite my mum's advice to sleep, I couldn't, so I sat thinking until I felt better and watched TV. Dinner was light. Before bed, my mum gave me medicine for my headache. I lay awake for hours, but eventually fell asleep. The next morning, I still felt bad, so I stayed home. My mum's friend visited with some entertainment, which helped pass the time. By night, I felt much better and fit again. The following morning, with the sun shining and birds chirping, I was fully recovered and ready to return to school.

My Likes

I have certain affections and dislikes. I adore technology and innovation because it keeps my mind engaged with endless possibilities and learning opportunities. Without it, I think I would grow bored. I also adore my favorite activities like skating and mountain climbing. They have a special place in my life, and they make me feel alive.

I feel confident engaging in these activities because they're challenging and rewarding. My third favorite interest is farming and animal husbandry. It's the ideal balance to my technological interests because it keeps me grounded and connected to nature.

Growing up in rural Kenya, I also had a deep appreciation for the stories and traditions that my family shared. My grandparents' tales of our ancestors were particularly captivating. They had a way of bringing history to life, painting vivid pictures of resilience, strength, and triumph. These stories instilled a sense of pride and identity in me, reminding me of the rich heritage I belonged to.

In addition to these cherished activities, I had a few more things that I loved during my childhood. One of them was my collection of technical tools and equipment. Innovation and creation were my passions. Their stories of innovation and progress resonated with me deeply. I spent countless hours tinkering and experimenting, imagining myself creating new solutions. The technical projects were more than just hobbies; they were sources of inspiration and empowerment.

Another favorite was my skating gear. It was my ticket to freedom, allowing me to explore my neighborhood and beyond. Skating with friends, racing down the streets, and feeling the wind on my face were some of the most exhilarating moments of my childhood. My skating adventures were a blend of joy, discovery, and a bit of mischief, creating memories that I still cherish today.

My Dislikes

Now, on to the things I'm not particularly fond of.

Firstly, there's limitation and restriction. Despite knowing that some boundaries are necessary, I prefer having the freedom to explore and innovate. Every time I feel constrained, I can't help but feel annoyed. I've tried expressing my need for creative freedom.

In addition, I'm not fond of injustice and inequality. The situation in many African countries is troubling, and the mistreatment of people I find completely unappealing. Every time I learn about oppression, it makes me concerned. The worst part is that these issues seem to be persistent across our continent. I can't understand why anyone would deny people their basic rights and dignity.

Bureaucracy is another thing I can't stand. It has a way of slowing down progress that I find completely off-putting. Every time I encounter unnecessary red tape, I'm reminded of how much I dislike it. The inefficiency is just as unpleasant as the delay it causes, making it impossible for me to appreciate. I've tried to work within various systems, but nothing can mask that frustration I find so revolting.

Lastly, I detest wasted potential. It used to bother me seeing opportunities for African advancement being squandered, which kept me up thinking about solutions. The repetitive cycles of underdevelopment were nothing short of frustrating. It didn't matter how tired I was; the incessant news of missed opportunities would occupy my thoughts, leaving me determined to make a change. Thankfully, I've learned to channel this frustration into constructive action. I can finally work toward solutions without the constant annoyance of feeling helpless.

These dislikes, though varied, have each left a strong impression on me. Whether it's personal limitations, social injustices, inefficient systems, or wasted potential, they all contribute to my list of things I'm determined to help change in our society.

Looking ahead, I harbor aspirations and dreams that fuel my ambition. I aspire to become a leader and innovator, driven by my love for Africa and the desire to help unite and develop our continent. I have always been fascinated by African history and potential, and the idea of being able to contribute to its development and ensure its proper place in the world is something I am passionate about.

Furthermore, I dream of exploring different African cultures by traveling around the continent. I am curious about how people live in different parts of Africa, their traditions, and their way of life. I hope to visit various African countries, learn new African languages, and immerse myself in different African cultures.

I am committed to making a positive impact in my community through innovation and contributing to meaningful causes. I believe that even small actions can make a big difference, and I want to be a part of efforts that improve the lives of others. Whether it's through technological solutions, agricultural innovation, or educational programs, I am determined to give back to the community.

Continuously seeking knowledge and personal growth remains a steadfast goal of mine. I want to keep learning and improving myself, both academically and personally. I believe that education is a lifelong journey, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.

I sincerely appreciate your interest in learning more about my personal and professional journey thus far. My experiences at various schools have shaped me into the person I am today, and I am grateful for the opportunities and support I have received along the way. I am filled with eager anticipation for the adventures and opportunities that are yet to come as I continue to explore life with intense curiosity, passion, and unwavering determination. Thank you for taking the time to read my autobiography.

High School
Introduction

Alex Ngari Weru is my name, I reside in Nyeri County. After completion of my primary school studies from Snow View Academy, I left for home. There I was to pass through the rite of passage as it is a norm in the Kikuyu culture for young boys entering in their adolescent stage. After this period, what followed was the short wait for admission to high school of your choice according to your grades in primary school. When the results of the final year exams were released, I was very anxious of the grades I had scored. Despite the anxiety, I was still confident that I had done me and my parents proud. Having performed well, I felt it was still good work done. Many people were fascinated with the marks I had scored and so was I.

A celebration was organized to celebrate the success. I had a strong belief that truly my hard work did not go in vain. After this followed a period to wait for the allocation to the high schools of our choice. My good performance led to receiving admission to Chinga Boys High School. This gave an opportunity to explore new environments and interact with other people from different walks of life.

Chinga Boys High School is located in Kenya, Central Province specifically in Nyeri County. The school has grown to become one of the respectable secondary schools. With its location, it provides a serene and good environment for learning. Its motto and principles keep the students and teachers motivated to ensure continued growth.

School Admission

Being admitted there was an important thing in my life. This school taught me so much that I did not know about life like resilience and consistency. I come from a family that has shaped me to whom I am today, so blending in and adaptation was manageable.

My parents both carry a legacy of hard work and resilience, having been raised in humble beginnings together with my siblings with opportunities they created through determination.

Despite their experiences, they instilled in my siblings and I the importance of education, navigating the challenges of life with love, support and a few life lessons along the way.

Both of my parents value education and technical skills. Their focus was on nurturing our passions. I have found memories of my parents supporting my education always there to answer questions, but never pressuring me to achieve stellar grades. This balanced approach only came clear to me later in high school, when I realized that the true value of education went beyond grades and accolades. Their unconditional support gave me the confidence to pursue my interests, making them exceedingly proud when they saw my gradual accomplishments during that period in school.

Education became a turning point not just for me but for my entire family. Seeing my siblings and I navigate our academic lives inspired our family. My parents, having come from backgrounds where higher education was valued, instilled in us the belief that with hard work and determination, we could achieve whatever we set our minds to.

Growing up, we valued our family bonds and traditions. Our home was filled with warmth and love, which created a strong foundation for our development. Our weekends were often spent working on family projects, sharing stories, and learning from one another. Through my parents' guidance, I felt nurtured and cared for, knowing they trusted me to make the right choices as long as I remained focused on school.

School Life

As I began my secondary school life, my love for sports began to flourish, especially soccer and other physical activities. My fondest memory is from form one, during my early days of playing; it was the first time I stood on the field, nervous and excited. While I didn't shine that day, the spark within me ignited. I realized that sports and leadership were my passion—activities that combined physical activity and strategy, enthralling me from that moment onward. Reflecting on those early days, I decided then to take my personal development seriously. What started as school activities transformed into an essential part of my identity.

High School Hobbies and Activities

Practicing various sports in the school fields and spending hours developing my skills brought me happiness and taught me the value of dedication and hard work. Over the years, I improved my abilities and joined school teams. Whether we won or lost, the camaraderie formed with teammates was priceless. Our shared experiences translated into our activities, developing a bond that extended beyond the sport itself.

At Chinga Boys High School, I adopted a more serious approach to my studies while juggling sports and various extracurricular activities. I wasn't the top student, but I was committed. Participating in team sports taught me about the essence of dedication and the importance of working collaboratively with others. Each activity boosted my confidence and established friendships that enriched my high school journey.

My involvement in clubs helped elevate my high school experience. I also participated in various school activities where I learned valuable life skills like discipline and leadership qualities. Each of these experiences contributed to shaping my worldview, teaching me about responsibility and teamwork.

High School Memories

One of the most defining moments of my high school experience came when I discovered my interest in technology and innovation. Technical projects became an outlet for expression, allowing me to develop thoughts and ideas that were important to me. I eagerly engaged in technical projects, which taught me the significance of research, clarity, and implementation.

One of the pivotal moments during my high school years was engaging in various practical projects. My classmates and I dedicated time to our projects, testing ideas and building models while nurturing a spirit of friendly competition. I chose to explore various innovations, creating systems that captured attention.

This event highlighted the importance of teamwork, as we frequently collaborated with our teachers and peers to refine our ideas and presentation skills. The thrill of presenting our projects and receiving constructive feedback was not only nerve-racking but deeply satisfying, fostering my love for learning and innovation.

Giving back to the society

In addition to academic events, I was fortunate to attend various leadership and community service functions. One initiative that left an indelible mark was community involvement. The purpose was to support local development and educational awareness. Gathering early with friends and community members, we donned appropriate attire and set out on activities that brought us through familiar streets while encouraging camaraderie and shared purpose. The feeling of giving back heightened my sense of community and further motivated my commitment to social responsibility.

Academic Achievements

The multitude of activities I engaged in included various academic pursuits. Competing against students from various backgrounds was exhilarating, filled with both anxiety and excitement. My preparation involved study sessions with teachers and problem-solving with friends. Although I did not always win top prizes, the journey of preparing together taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, determination, and the value of hard work.

Engaging in these initiatives not only expanded my perspective but reinforced my conviction that education is not only beneficial on a personal level but can uplift the entire community. I found motivation in helping others gain access to opportunities that might have been out of reach without support, fueling my resolve to contribute positively to society.

Academically, I participated in activities for subjects I was passionate about. Though not all competitions ended in success, each challenge taught me resilience. The most gratifying part of school wasn't just the academics, but the memories forged with friends during activities and preparation for various events. I made it a point to explore and engage with all aspects of school life, finding that every experience contributed to my personal growth.

Outside academic pursuits, I also had the opportunity to attend cultural events. Participating in school events was a highlight of my high school experience. I performed activities that discussed my experiences navigating life with hopes and dreams.

It was nerve-wracking getting up in front of people, but the supportive environment encouraged me to express myself more confidently. We celebrated each other's talents, which fostered a strong sense of camaraderie and acceptance within our school community.

Moreover, I played roles in organizing various school activities. Leading or participating in organization required collaboration with faculty members and fellow students, from planning to logistics. The weeks leading up to events were hectic, filled with meetings and preparations, but the sense of accomplishment following the success of the events was rewarding. Witnessing activities unfold, filled with passionate participation, reinforced my belief in the importance of engagement and diverse perspectives.

In my high school years at Chinga Boys High School were enriched by a variety of occasions and functions, both academic and extracurricular. Through activities, leadership initiatives, community service, and cultural celebrations, I learned invaluable skills in teamwork, communication, and resilience. These experiences not only laid the groundwork for my academic pursuits but also cultivated lasting friendships and cherished memories that I will carry with me as I embark on new challenges in the next stages of my life. Each moment helped shape my identity and further ignited my passion for education and community involvement.

As I matured, I began reflecting on my goals and aspirations. I established a clear vision for what I wanted in my life, and I learned the importance of effective planning. I recognized various aspects I wanted to change, such as being more organized in my studies and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This strategy became a guiding principle as I approached both my academic and personal endeavors. I faced several hurdles throughout my academic journey. Instead of succumbing to negativity, I focused on transformative learning experiences. I understood that each obstacle was an opportunity for growth, helping me evolve. With the unwavering support of my parents and mentors in my life, I discovered the importance of self-belief and resilience.

Over time, I recognized the importance of being specific about what I wanted in life. My "self-discovery" journey involved noting down those aspects I didn't want—like inconsistency or feeling unproductive—and focusing on what I genuinely desired. I wanted to be impactful, both locally and globally, and I craved the progress that comes from persistence and hard work.

This practice of identification and affirmation became my roadmap, guiding me through both triumphs and challenges.

Adopting a more positive attitude toward life helped me confront difficulties with resilience. I learned that challenges were simply part of the journey, and they shaped me into a better individual. If there were setbacks, I viewed them as stepping stones rather than disruptions. Encouraged by supportive parents who trusted my decisions, I was able to press forward, unscathed by the occasional bumps in the road.

Despite the joyful moments and accomplishments, my life was not without its struggles. My family faced challenges, just like any other, but we embraced them as learning opportunities. I realized early on that life is an ever-changing journey filled with ups and downs. I learned how to appreciate the small things, finding joy even in adversity, and recognizing that every experience, good or bad, played a significant role in crafting who I was becoming.

I also saw firsthand that everyone has their issues; life isn't defined by the perfection of those around us but by our ability to adapt and grow. Witnessing development in my community sparked a fire within me. The progress I observed showed me the strength of determination and motivated me to set ambitious goals for my future, inevitably paving my path forward as I approached new stages in life.

Now, as I progressed through education, I look back at my high school journey with pride and gratitude. I am immensely thankful for every experience—both the highs and lows—that shaped my character and helped me discover who I am. My positive attitude continues to guide me, keeping me motivated as I face numerous new challenges on the horizon. I have a supportive family and friends who encourage me to pursue my dreams, and I hope to inspire others with stories of my journey.

Looking ahead, my goal is to continue evolving, whether through education, innovation, or personal endeavors. As I step into greater responsibilities, I carry with me the lessons learned, the struggles overcome, and the love of those who have cheered me on in this incredible journey. I am blessed beyond measure and equipped to face life's challenges with a grateful heart, looking forward to a bright and hopeful future. Thanks to God, my family, and the experiences that have shaped me, I am excited about what lies ahead!

Campus Life
Introduction

Hello, my name is Alex Ngari Weru, an undergraduate student at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology. My life at campus is dynamic and transformative. With no single word to fully capture the experience, here is my story from the very beginning to where I am now. The experience has been amazing and adventurous at the same time.

Pre-University Preparation

It was just after completing my high school studies from Chinga Boys High School, I went through the university placement process. With some guidance from mentors, I decided to apply to universities that aligned with my interests and goals. This included; DeKUT (Dedan Kimathi University of Technology), among others.

Applying to tertiary schools was a detailed process. I spent time researching different universities, reading about their programs, campus culture and opportunities. I carefully considered my options, considering my academic achievements, extracurricular activities and aspirations. Required documents and attachments played a key role in qualifying for placement in the institutions. I sought feedback from my high school teachers, mentors, peers, friends and family to ensure I made the right choices.

The waiting period after submitting applications required patience. All along I remained focused and hopeful.

One day, while I was engaged in activities I received communication indicating my acceptance to university. Once I received acceptance, it was time to make decisions about which school to attend, which programs to pursue, and how to manage the various aspects, including tuition fees and other expenses. I considered several institutions and spoke with students and faculty. When making these decisions, there were many factors to consider such as location, academic programs offered, extracurricular activities available, and more.

After much deliberation and many fruitful conversations with my family members and other parties involved, I settled for Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.

About School

This school has an excellent reputation. Being named after a famous hero, liberator and MauMau freedom fighter, I was sure that this was the right place for me. Furthermore, the institution is in my home county. It is located in Nyeri County, Nyeri Town Constituency, and Mathari-Kiganjo Ward. Situated along the Nyeri highway between Mt. Kenya and the Aberdare Ranges, it spans substantial acreage consisting of natural forest, agricultural land and space for expansion.

The institution is well equipped with the right facilities and equipment to enhance students' studies hence providing holistic and quality education as well as involving students in different extra-curricular activities including clubs and societies.

School Life

With everything set and good to go, I reported to the university in the main campus. Once I was accepted into college, it was time for me to make the transition from high school life to college life; this included finding housing and getting involved in extracurricular activities on campus. For accommodation and housing, I decided that living in the dorms would be beneficial since it allowed me to form connections with fellow students while also having access to resources like libraries or computer labs.

Academics

At the university, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I was motivated to take this course due the use and growth of technology in current times where entities leverage the use of technology including; AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), IOT (Internet of Things), Data Science etc.

When classes commenced, everything changed. It felt like there were many things happening at once; lectures, extracurricular activities, exam preparation, it was overwhelming and at the same time exciting. The first weeks were a blur of attending orientation events, meeting new people and navigating the campus environment. However, as time passed, I settled into a routine and began to make friends along the way. Joining different clubs and societies participating in campus activities helped me feel more connected and engaged.

Academically, university was a significant step up from high school. The coursework which began with basics of Information Technology and introduction to computer basics, laying a strong foundation for more advanced topics. It was more challenging to adapt and expectations were much higher. I quickly had to develop new study habits and time management skills to keep up with the rigorous curriculum. For success, I had to craft new study strategies, prioritize tasks, create study schedules. Study sessions and reviews became a routine, emphasizing the importance of consistency and discipline. Group projects, presentations pushed me out of my comfort zone, teaching me valuable collaboration, team work and communication skills.

Collaboration with course mates, brainstorming ideas, and coordinating efforts to meet deadlines not only fine-tuned my skills but also helped me develop strong interpersonal skills. My lecturers, professors were resourceful and supportive and approachable, always willing to offer guidance and feedback. Office hours became essential, allowing me to seek clarification on challenging topics.

In there, I have also discovered numerous resources that made university life more manageable. The university offered numerous resources, including books, journals and online materials in the library.
